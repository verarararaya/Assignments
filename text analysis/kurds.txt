Need to put an urgent Economic sanctions on Turkey for its genocidal attack on Kurds.

¡°And if the Kurds do back up, I hope they do,because it's very hard to beat a force without planes,(Turkey) have weapons, the Kurds don't, we paid a lot of money to the Kurds,and don't forget, they are fighting for their land, not for us¡±
