No doubt, the Red Hat acquisition is a big deal, in numerous senses of the phrase. When the deal was first announced, it valued Red Hat at a purchase price of $33 billion, approximately 30% of IBM's market capitalization at the time. IBM eventually paid $34 billion for the firm, making it not only the company's largest acquisition ever, equalling roughly the combined value of the deals it has done in the past 15 years, but it is also one of the largest deals in U.S. tech history. The hope is that Red Hat will help IBM more effectively penetrate the cloud-computing market, and that the combination will allow IBM to sell more of its software to Red Hat Users and get more of its IBM customers to become Red Hat users. "OpenShift [a Red Hat product] should help IBM win new customers and new workloads as enterprises begin to usher mission-critical applications from on-premise to public or private clouds," wrote Nomura Instinet analysts led by Jeffrey Kvaal in a note back in April. The big challenge associated with pushing further into cloud computing is having to compete with big name's like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which currently dominate the market. As of 2017, IBM was ranked fifth in the world for providing public cloud-infrastructure. Improving that ranking won't be easy, but at the very least, trying to improve will likely help boost its stock, which is still about 12% below its all-time high.
